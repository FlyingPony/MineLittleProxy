HOW TO PROXY COMMANDS

/proxy say <text>
> Pass <text> on directly to the server, e.g "/proxy say /proxy" would
> result in "/proxy" being sent to the server.

/proxy quit
> Disconnect all of the currently connected players, and kicks you. Keep in mind it
> doesn't close down the proxy server, so you can rejoin without restarting the proxy.

/proxy connect <server> <username>
> Connects the player <username> to a given server. The server may deny
> the newer connection and keep the older one.

/proxy switch <server> <username>
> Changes what player you are playing as. The server option is necessary as the same
> player could be connected to multiple servers at once.

/proxy disconnect <server> <username>
> Logs out a given player out of the given server. If you end the player that you
> are controlling, you won't automatically switched to another player.
